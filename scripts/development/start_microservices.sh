# -E: ERR trap is inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and subshells
# -e: Exit immediately if any command returns non-zero status (fails)
# -u: Treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately
# -o pipefail: Pipeline exit status is the last command that failed, or zero if all succeed
# This helps catch common programming errors and prevents silent failures
