## Authentication Flow

The authentication system follows a secure, multi-step process:

1. **Registration**: User provides email and optional password
2. **Verification**: Email verification code sent and validated
3. **Authentication**: User signs in using chosen method
4. **Session**: JWT tokens issued for authenticated sessions
5. **Refresh**: Tokens automatically refreshed before expiration (✅ Implemented)

## Security Features

All authentication features implement comprehensive security measures:

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and abuse
- **Input Validation**: Sanitizes and validates all user input
- **Secure Storage**: Passwords hashed, tokens encrypted
- **HTTPS Only**: All authentication endpoints require TLS
- **CORS Protection**: Configured for secure cross-origin requests

## Integration Points

Authentication features integrate with:

- **Frontend Components**: React components in `clients/auth-sample/src/components/auth/`
- **Backend Services**: gRPC services in `microservices/Auth/`
- **Infrastructure**: AWS Cognito, DynamoDB, and SES
- **Security**: Rate limiting, JWT validation, and error handling

## Testing

Each authentication feature includes comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end authentication flows
- **Security Tests**: Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- **UI Tests**: Frontend component behavior
