# Infrastructure Features

This section documents the infrastructure components, deployment configurations, and operational aspects of the authentication system.

## Features Overview

### [Terraform Deployment](terraform-deployment.md)
Infrastructure as Code implementation using Terraform for AWS deployment.

**Key capabilities:**
- Single-AZ deployment configuration
- AWS resource provisioning (EC2, NLB, Route53)
- Environment-specific configurations
- State management and versioning
- Automated deployment and teardown

### [Docker Containerization](docker-containerization.md)
Container orchestration using Docker and Docker Swarm for development and deployment.

**Key capabilities:**
- Multi-service container orchestration
- Development environment consistency
- Service discovery and networking
- Volume management and persistence
- Health checks and auto-recovery

### [Monitoring & Observability](monitoring-observability.md)
Comprehensive monitoring and observability using OpenTelemetry and Aspire dashboard.

**Key capabilities:**
- Distributed tracing across services
- Metrics collection and visualization
- Structured logging aggregation
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Development observability dashboard

### [Load Balancing](load-balancing.md)
Traffic distribution and routing using Envoy proxy and AWS Network Load Balancer.

**Key capabilities:**
- API Gateway functionality with Envoy
- gRPC-Web protocol translation
- Health check and failover
- SSL termination and routing
- Production load balancing with AWS NLB

## Infrastructure Architecture

The infrastructure follows cloud-native principles:

1. **Containerization**: All services containerized for consistency
2. **Orchestration**: Docker Swarm for development, AWS for production
3. **Service Mesh**: Envoy proxy for service communication
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible deployments

## Deployment Environments

### Development Environment
- **Docker Swarm**: Local container orchestration
- **Aspire Dashboard**: Development observability
- **Local Databases**: PostgreSQL and Redis containers
- **SSL Certificates**: Self-signed for local development

### Production Environment
- **AWS EC2**: Compute instances with auto-scaling
- **Network Load Balancer**: High-performance traffic distribution
- **Route53**: DNS management and health checks
- **CodeDeploy**: Automated deployment pipeline
- **CloudWatch**: Production monitoring and alerting

## Infrastructure Components

### Core Services
- **API Gateway**: Envoy proxy for routing and protocol translation
- **Authentication Service**: .NET gRPC microservice
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Cache**: Redis for session storage and rate limiting
- **Frontend**: Next.js application with static asset serving

### Supporting Services
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry collector and Aspire dashboard
- **Logging**: Structured logging with centralized collection
- **Health Checks**: Service health monitoring and reporting
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration

## Operational Procedures

### Deployment
1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform apply
2. **Service Deployment**: CodeDeploy automation
3. **Health Validation**: Automated health checks
4. **Traffic Routing**: Gradual traffic migration
5. **Monitoring**: Post-deployment validation

### Maintenance
- **Updates**: Rolling updates with zero downtime
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling based on metrics
- **Backup**: Automated database and configuration backup
- **Security**: Regular security updates and patches

## Integration Points

Infrastructure features integrate with:

- **Application Services**: Hosting and runtime environment
- **Security**: Network security and access controls
- **Monitoring**: Performance and health monitoring
- **Development**: Local development environment consistency
