- **Container Ready**: Full Docker support with Docker Swarm orchestration
- **Production Ready**: Includes logging, monitoring, health checks, and AWS deployment

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 9.0, gRPC, ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3+, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Envoy Proxy, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Aspire Dashboard (Dev), CloudWatch (Prd)

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into two main sections:

1. **Features**: Detailed documentation of individual system features, organized by functional area
2. **Guides**: Step-by-step guides for setup, deployment, and maintenance tasks

Each feature document follows a consistent structure with overview, implementation details, configuration, usage instructions, testing guidance, and troubleshooting information.
